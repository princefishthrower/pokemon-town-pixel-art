Goldenrod City, printed in weird hex form.

# Pokemon Town Pixel Art!

This code corresponds with this blog post: [https://chrisfrew.in/blog/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/)

All of the generated images are already in this repository, but if you would like to tinker and re run the code, it runs simply with `python main.py` - looping through all 20 cities, making the png and svg tiles, as well as the neat hex art.

Check out `printer.py` if you want to try building your own patterns - you'll see I started one idea with a binary tree style of print
